When first getting the Dockerfile run: 
    "docker build -t rubycustom ." 
in a directory with the Dockerfile
    NOTE: do not rename the file or this will not work
    NOTE: This process may take awhile, this is normal

After the image is created run:
docker run --name rubytest -p 127.0.0.2:3000:3000 -dit rubycustom bash
    --name names the container
    -p 127.0.0.2:3000:3000 maps the 127.0.0.2:3000 to port 3000 in the container
        # NOTE 3000 is the default port rails listens on
    -dit starts the container detached, starts an interactive session, simulates tty

To access the container you use: "docker attach rubytest"
If you close the container you must use: "docker start rubytest" followed by "docker attach rubytest"

When in the container you can modify the files in /Ephemeral to modify the rails environment
When testing you can use "rails server -b 0.0.0.0"
